# Temporary-password-generator
This is a temporary password generator built with python. I used the Twilio API to send the OTPs to the provided phone number. I used the front end as HTML, CSS and JS its just a simple website where the user enters their name and employee code and also their phone number. The logic of this program is done through python.
